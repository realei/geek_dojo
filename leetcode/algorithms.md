### Problems Solved

* Combinatorial search problems: Combinatorial search problems involve finding groupings and assignments of objects that satisfy certain conditions. Finding all permutations, combinations, subsets and solving sudoku are classic combinatorial problems.

* The algorithm we use to solve a combinatorial search problem is often called backtracking.

* Note: in backtracking, we are not given a tree to traverse but rather **we construct the tree/ generate the edges and tree nodes as we go**.
