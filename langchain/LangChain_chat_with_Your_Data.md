## Introduction

Large Langusge models or LLMs such as ChatGPT can answer questions about a lot of topics. But LLMs in isolation knows only what it was trained on, which doesn't include your personal data, such as if you're in a company and have proprietary documents not on the internet, as well as data or articles that were written after the LLM was trained.

So wouldn't it be useful if you or others such as your customers can have a conversation with your own documents and get questions answered using information from those documents and using an LLM?
